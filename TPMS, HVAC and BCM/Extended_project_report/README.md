## Extended Project Abstract  

The automotive industry is rapidly transitioning towards smarter and more efficient vehicle architectures. Traditional systems relying on centralized wiring and control are being replaced with zonal architectures to improve scalability, energy efficiency, and modularity. This mini-project focuses on the integration of Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS), Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), and Body Control Modules (BCM) within a zonal architecture framework.  

The primary objective of this project is to develop a prototype that demonstrates the potential of a zonal architecture in optimizing functionality and reducing the complexity of modern automotive systems. Key features of the project include real-time tire pressure monitoring, zonal temperature regulation, and centralized body control functionality. By using microcontrollers and sensor networks, the system efficiently manages data flow and control signals across defined zones, minimizing wiring and improving energy efficiency.  

The project was executed in phases, starting with a literature review of existing TPMS, HVAC, and BCM systems. This was followed by the design and simulation of the proposed zonal architecture using tools like Tinkercad and Simulink. Prototyping involved integrating temperature and pressure sensors with LEDs to simulate real-world scenarios. For instance, LEDs were programmed to respond to tire pressure and temperature thresholds, providing visual feedback for monitoring and safety purposes.  

Outcomes of the project include reduced system complexity, improved energy efficiency through localized control, and a scalable design that can accommodate additional functionalities with minimal modifications. The zonal approach also enhances system reliability by isolating faults to specific zones, simplifying troubleshooting and maintenance.  

In conclusion, this project highlights the advantages of zonal architecture in automotive systems and lays the groundwork for its implementation in larger-scale applications. The results are documented and presented for further exploration and potential deployment in real-world scenarios.
